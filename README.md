# Machine Learning Basics

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms and concepts. Each project or example is designed to reinforce my understanding of core principles, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. Through this hands-on approach, I aim to build a solid foundation in machine learning and develop the skills necessary for more advanced topics and applications. Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or provide feedback!
