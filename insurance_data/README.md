#Machine Learning Insurance Prediction

This repository contains a Python-based machine learning model to predict whether a person will buy insurance based on their age and affordability. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained with a dataset containing information on customersâ€™ age, affordability, and insurance purchasing behavior. The project demonstrates the basics of binary classification using a neural network, along with model evaluation using a confusion matrix.

## Project Structure
- **insurance_data.csv:** Dataset containing the features and target labels.
- **train_test_split:** Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training:** A single-layer neural network is trained to predict insurance purchasing behavior.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model is evaluated using accuracy and binary cross-entropy loss.
- **Confusion Matrix:** A heatmap of the confusion matrix shows model performance on the test set.

## Key Libraries
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Used for creating and training the neural network model.
- **Pandas and NumPy:** For data manipulation.
- **Seaborn and Matplotlib:** For plotting the confusion matrix.
